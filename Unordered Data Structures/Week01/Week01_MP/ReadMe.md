# What is the MP for
This project focuses on practical usage of hash tables in C++. Rather than implementing a hash table
from scratch, we’ll make use of std::unordered_map, a templated hash table implementation that is
provided by the C++ Standard Template Library. We’ll show you the syntax and a few points of caution.
We’ll also discuss the std::pair type and how STL handles hashing of key types for std::unordered_map.
Lastly, we’ll give an example of “memoization,” an important optimization technique that can make good
use of the expected constant-time lookups that a hash table can offer. (There is relatively more reading
than coding required in this project.)
