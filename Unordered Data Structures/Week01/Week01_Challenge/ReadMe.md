# What is the Challenge for
This insert function should first compute a specific hash function of value. This hash function should return the least-significant three decimal digits (a number from 0 to 999) of the variable value. This hash result should be used as an index into the thousand-element vector table that has been previously initialized with -1 in each element. If the element at this location of table is available (currently set to -1), you can replace the element with value. If this location is not available (currently set to some other value than -1) then you should check the next element, repeatedly, until you find an available element and can store value there. The insert() function should then return the number of times a location in the hash table was identified to store the given value but was not available.
