# What is the Challenge for
Your job is to implement the procedure "downHeap(Node *n)" . The procedure should assume that n->left is the root of a min heap subtree (or nullptr) and the same for n->right.  The value at Node *n (specifically n->value) might not be less than the values in its left subtree and in its right subtree, and so the tree with Node *n as its root might not be a min heap (even though its left subtree and right subtree are both min heaps). Your code should modify the tree rooted at Node *n so it is a min heap. You do not need to balance the tree or turn it into a complete tree. You only need to ensure that the tree satisfies the min heap property:
