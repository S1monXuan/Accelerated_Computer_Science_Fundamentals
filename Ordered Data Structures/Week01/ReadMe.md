# What is the MP for
In this assignment, we provide you with a templated LinkedList class, that is a doubly-linked list data
structure. You’ll implement some of the member functions for this class that perform insertions and create
sorted copies of lists. In the process you’ll see how to traverse a list with pointers, how to connect nodes in a
doubly-linked list, and see how the classic “merge sort” and “merge” algorithms work.
