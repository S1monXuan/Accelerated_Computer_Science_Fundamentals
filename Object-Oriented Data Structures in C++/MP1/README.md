# What is the MP for
By now you've had a chance to learn about basic program structure, classes, and functions in C++. You've also
had a chance to try compiling a few programs and experimenting on the command line. Now it's time to try out
a more free-form coding project in your IDE. At the University of Illinois, programming assignments are fondly
referred to as MPs, although there's some debate about whether that stands for "machine-processed" or
"machine problem." Perhaps a reminder of the days when students had to work out programs on paper and
submit them on punch cards for batch processing by a mainframe in a separate building. You could say this is
your MP1. Coincidentally, you might also prefer to use the Cloud9 IDE to work on your assignment.

In this assignment, you will begin with foundational work that will be used for several future assignments in
this course. Specifically, in Part 1 you will create a simple C++ class that represents a colored pixel; you are
also provided with a PNG image class that encapsulates the loading and saving of image files. (You do not need
to implement the PNG class yourself, but you'll find it enlightening to study the code provided.) In Part 2, you
will use the pixel and PNG classes from Part 1 to transform an image in several different ways.
